The program consists of 6 different sorting algorithm, each have their own special way to sorting a list of numbers. The user is allowed to pick the amount of numbers he/she wants sorted and choose which sorting algorithm he/she wants to sort it with, the program will then return a list of random numbers based on the amount given by the user, a sorted version the same list, the sorting algorithm used and the time taken to do the sorting

### Sorting Algorithms Used

### Binary Tree

A binary tree is a rooted binary tree data structure whose internal nodes each store a key greater than all the keys in the nodeâ€™s left subtree and less than those in its right subtree. A binary tree is a type of data structure for storing data such as numbers in an organized way. ![360px-Binary_search_tree svg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15141836/146362515-c9443794-c375-484e-9c37-89db8fce755a.png)
